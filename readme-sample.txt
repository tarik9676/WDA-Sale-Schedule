Too much stress on sale day? Relaaaax!!! Prepare sales content a week/month/year ago without affecting your regular content and sales will be live whenever you want.

== Description ==

WDA Sale Schedule is specially built for woocommerce stores. Using this plugin store admins will be able to schedule contents to be changed at a certain time without loosing regular contents like product title, thumbnail, product status, stock status, stock quantity and much more.

Let's say, you have product named "Golden Smart Watch" regular priced $400 and you are planning to put it on sale at $350 then you can put a new title in the custom product title field as "Golden Smart Watch | $50 OFF!" and add the sale price too in the custom sale price input field. Also, you've to assign the designed publishing date in the schedule date & time. Which means you don't need to stay focused on the sale day to prepare the sale or no need to hire people to make it done. You can prepare the sale many days/months ago whenever you get some time.

Even though we change main contents by scheduling new contents, we won't loose regular/original contents. You can also add a restoring schedule date & time to restore regular contents automatically.
